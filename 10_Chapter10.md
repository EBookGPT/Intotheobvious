# Chapter 10: Trusting your intuition: methods and techniques

*In to the obvious* is not just about uncovering hidden insights and exploring the depths of your mind, but it is also about trusting your instincts. Intuition can sometimes be overlooked or ignored, but it is a powerful tool that can guide us through tough decisions and help us navigate life's challenges.

In this chapter, we will be exploring various methods and techniques for trusting your intuition, including some insights from the renowned author and journalist, Malcolm Gladwell. But first, let's recap what we learned in the previous chapter.

## The relationship between intuition and emotion 

We learned that emotions play a prominent role in intuition. Emotions can give us clues and insights that our rational mind may not be able to process. Additionally, emotions can influence the decisions and actions we take based on our intuition.

As Gladwell points out in his book "Blink," we often make split-second decisions based on our intuition, and these decisions can be just as accurate, if not more so, than decisions made after hours of analysis and research.

So, how do we develop and trust our intuition? Here are some methods and techniques that may help:

## Journaling and Self-Reflection

One effective way to connect with your intuition is to regularly reflect on your experiences and emotions through journaling. By writing down your thoughts, feelings, and insights, you can gain a deeper understanding of your inner voice and uncover patterns and insights that you may have overlooked.

## Mindfulness and Meditation

Practicing mindfulness and meditation can help calm your mind and increase your awareness of your thoughts and emotions. By being present in the moment and observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment, you can become more in-tune with your intuition and trust your instincts.

## Consulting with Experts

In some cases, it may be helpful to consult with experts, such as coaches or therapists, when making important decisions. These professionals can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings and provide insights that you may not have considered.

## Truster

Finally, using the `truster` function in Python can provide an objective measure of how much trust to place in a reported intuition. For example:

```
from into_the_obvious import truster
import numpy as np

# create a list of numbers
numbers = np.random.normal(50, 10, 100)

# calculate the mean of the numbers
mean = np.mean(numbers)

# trust the intuition that the mean is greater than 40
confidence = truster(mean > 40)

if confidence > 0.7:
    print("I trust my intuition that the mean is greater than 40")
else:
    print("I need more data to confirm my intuition")
```

In conclusion, intuition is a powerful tool that can guide us through life's challenges, but it can also be difficult to trust. By journaling, practicing mindfulness, consulting with experts, and using tools like `truster`, you can develop and trust your intuition with confidence. And who knows, you might even discover some hidden insights along the way!

"Trusting your intuition means tuning out second-guessing and self-doubt." - Malcolm Gladwell 

Malcolm Gladwell is a well-known author and journalist who has written extensively about the power of intuition. In his book "Blink," he explores the concept of "thin-slicing," or the ability to make split-second decisions based on limited information. He argues that we can train ourselves to cultivate this skill by paying attention to our emotions and learning to trust our instincts. 

Gladwell's insights and stories serve as an inspiration and reminder that while intuition may not always provide concrete answers, it can offer valuable insights and guidance that we should not ignore.
# Chapter 10: Trusting your intuition: methods and techniques

In Greek mythology, there was a goddess named Metis who was known for her wisdom and intelligence. However, she was feared by Zeus, the king of the gods, for her ability to outsmart him.

One day, Zeus learned of a prophecy that Metis would bear a child who would overthrow him. To prevent this from happening, Zeus swallowed Metis whole, but not before she was able to give birth to a daughter named Athena.

Athena was born fully grown and armored, and she quickly became known as the goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. She was known for her intelligence and quick decision-making skills, which were said to come from her mother Metis.

As mortals, we may not have the advantage of having a goddess for a mother, but we can still learn to trust our intuition and make wise decisions. In this chapter, we explored various methods and techniques for cultivating and trusting our intuition, and we gained valuable insights from special guest Malcolm Gladwell.

Malcolm Gladwell, in his book "Blink", argues that we can train ourselves to cultivate our intuition by paying attention to our emotions and learning to trust our instincts. He provides numerous examples of people making quick decisions based on their intuition, which were later proven to be accurate.

But how can we apply these insights to our own lives and decision-making processes?

One effective method for cultivating our intuition is journaling and self-reflection. By taking the time to reflect on our experiences, emotions, and insights, we can gain a deeper understanding of our inner voice and uncover patterns and insights that we may have overlooked.

We can also practice mindfulness and meditation to increase our awareness of our thoughts and emotions. By being present in the moment and observing our thoughts and feelings without judgment, we can become more in-tune with our intuition and trust our instincts.

In some cases, it may be helpful to consult with experts, such as coaches or therapists, when making important decisions. These professionals can help us clarify our thoughts and feelings and provide insights that we may not have considered.

Finally, we can use tools like the `truster` function in Python to provide an objective measure of how much trust to place in a reported intuition. By having a numerical value to quantify our intuition, we can make more informed decisions with confidence.

As mortals, we may not have the godly intelligence of Metis, but we can still cultivate our own intuition and wisdom. By using the methods and techniques we explored in this chapter and learning from the insights of Malcolm Gladwell, we can make wise decisions and trust our instincts like the goddess Athena.
Certainly! In the Greek Mythology epic, we learned about the goddess Athena and how she was known for her intelligence and quick decision-making skills, which were said to come from her mother Metis. 

In our modern-day world, we can also learn to trust our instincts and make wise decisions using various techniques and tools, one of which is the `truster` function in Python.

The `truster` function takes a proposition or statement as input and returns a numerical value between 0 and 1, representing the probability or degree of confidence that the proposition is true. 

Here is an example of how the `truster` function can be used:
```python
from into_the_obvious import truster
import numpy as np

# create a list of numbers
numbers = np.random.normal(50, 10, 100)

# calculate the mean of the numbers
mean = np.mean(numbers)

# trust the intuition that the mean is greater than 40
confidence = truster(mean > 40)

if confidence > 0.7:
    print("I trust my intuition that the mean is greater than 40")
else:
    print("I need more data to confirm my intuition")
```

In this example, we first use NumPy to create a list of 100 random numbers with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. We then calculate the mean of the numbers and use the `truster` function to determine the level of confidence that the mean is greater than 40.

If the confidence level is greater than 0.7, we output a message saying that we trust our intuition. Otherwise, we output a message saying that we need more data to confirm our intuition.

The `truster` function can be a helpful tool for making decisions and trusting our intuition. By having a numerical value to quantify our intuition, we can make more informed decisions and trust our instincts with greater confidence.
